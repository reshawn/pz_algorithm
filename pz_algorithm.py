def get_local_extrema(series, extrema):
    '''
    Get local maxima or minima of a series.
    A maxima or peak is defined as a point where the current value is greater than the values directly preceding and succeeding it.
    In the case of consecutive equal values, the current value is compared to the last or next different value.
    i.e. if today's price is greater than yesterday's and tomorrow's price, then today is a peak.
    similarly, if today's price is less than yesterday's and tomorrow's price, then today is a trough.
